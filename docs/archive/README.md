# Archive

This folder stores historical documentation that is no longer authoritative for the current CNFund architecture.

- `legacy-streamlit/`: Streamlit/Supabase era docs, incident notes, and one-off fixes.
- `plans/`: historical planning documents kept for traceability.

Use active docs under `docs/` for deployment and operations.
